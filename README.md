EYTCA is a YouTube channel aggregator which displays the latest videos for all of a user's subscriptions within a specified date range.

This service was designed for people who use YouTube as a replacement for cable television. Navigating YouTube when one has numerous subscriptions can become cumbersome, so this service is ideal to view all of your favourite channel's new videos at a glance.
